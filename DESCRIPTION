Description: Functions to facilitate fitting of a Bayesian HMM (Hidden Markov
    Model) to influenza sentinel surveillance data, segment the surveillance
    period into five epidemic phases (pre-epidemic, epidemic growth, epidemic 
    plateau, epidemic decline and post-epidemic phase) and determine the
    weekly posterior probability of each phase. Results can be summarized and
    graphically plotted.
